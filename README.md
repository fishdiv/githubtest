# Welcome to my Final Project

This is the documentation for my "Favorites" site that I made in Mobile Application Development, a class from Rasmussen College.  This web application uses the data-role attribute and jQuery to create pages and a navigation panel all from a single HTML document.

## Site Structure

Home Page Panel
- Hobbies
- Food
- Projects
- Music
- Family
- Business
- Contact Me

## Button Descriptions by page:

### Music
- Blues, Rock, Country, and Pop are all buttons that should display their text in the "You chose: " textbox at the bottom of the page.

### Contact Me
- Reset Button - clears the form textboxes
- Submit Button - posts the contents of the form
- Clear localStorage - clears local storage on browser
- Empty localStorage - empties local storage on browser
